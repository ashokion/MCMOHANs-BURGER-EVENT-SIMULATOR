# MCMOHANs-BURGER-EVENT-SIMULATOR
This project is an efficient implementation of simulation environment in a burger shop with K counters and M gas stoves with no dine in allowed. 

The simulation is driven by events. Events in our simulation environment are arrival/departure of a customer, completion of payment for an order, completion of one or more burgers, etc.
For complete problem statement refer to A3.pdf file.

Finally to improve customers experience some statistics like average waiting time, queue length, customer wait time has been calculated.


Technolgies used: Java, OOPS

Data sturctures: Heap, Trees, Queue, Arrays
